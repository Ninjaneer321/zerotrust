# Moving the U.S. Government Towards Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles

The [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) (OMB) and the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://cisa.gov) (CISA) are **seeking public feedback** on strategic and technical guidance documents meant to **move the U.S. government towards a zero trust architecture**.

This repository powers the website at https://zerotrust.cyber.gov. This website is currently oriented around 3 documents:

* OMB's **[Federal Zero Trust Strategy](https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/federal-zero-trust-strategy/)**. The goal of this strategy is to accelerate agencies towards a shared baseline of early zero trust maturity.

* CISA's **[Zero Trust Maturity Model](https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model/)**. The maturity model complements OMB's Federal Zero Trust Strategy, and is designed to provide agencies with a roadmap and resources to achieve an optimal zero trust environment.

* CISA's **[Cloud Security Technical Reference Architecture](https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/cloud-security-technical-reference-architecture)**, a guide for agencies to leverage when migrating to the cloud securely. The document explains considerations for shared services, cloud migration, and cloud security posture management.

The Federal Zero Trust Strategy is rendered in full web format in this website. CISA's documents above currently have landing pages with public comment instructions on this site, while their actual documents are hosted on [cisa.gov](https://cisa.gov).
