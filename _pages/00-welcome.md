# Welcoming public feedback

The [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) (OMB) is releasing a draft **[Federal Zero Trust Strategy](/federal-zero-trust-strategy/)** in support of [Executive Order 14028, "Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/), to adapt civilian agencies' enterprise security architecture to be based on zero trust principles.

The [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://cisa.gov) (CISA) is releasing the **[Zero Trust Maturity Model](/zero-trust-maturity-model/)** to assist agencies as they implement zero trust architectures. The maturity model complements OMB's Federal Zero Trust Strategy, and is designed to provide agencies with a roadmap and resources to achieve an optimal zero trust environment.

CISA is also releasing the **[Cloud Security Technical Reference Architecture](/cloud-security-technical-reference-architecture/)** as a guide for agencies to leverage when migrating to the cloud securely. The document explains considerations for shared services, cloud migration, and cloud security posture management.

OMB and CISA are **seeking public feedback** on these documents to strengthen enterprise security across the federal government.
