# Welcoming public feedback

The [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) (OMB) and the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://cisa.gov) (CISA) are **seeking public feedback** on strategic and technical guidance documents meant to **move the U.S. government towards a zero trust architecture**.

* Read and comment on OMB's **[Federal Zero Trust Strategy](/federal-zero-trust-strategy/)**. The goal of this strategy is to accelerate agencies towards a shared baseline of early zero trust maturity.

* Read and comment on CISA's **[Zero Trust Maturity Model](/zero-trust-maturity-model/)**. The maturity model complements OMB's Federal Zero Trust Strategy, and is designed to provide agencies with a roadmap and resources to achieve an optimal zero trust environment.

* Read and comment on CISA's **[Cloud Security Technical Reference Architecture](/cloud-security-technical-reference-architecture)**, a guide for agencies to leverage when migrating to the cloud securely. The document explains considerations for shared services, cloud migration, and cloud security posture management.
