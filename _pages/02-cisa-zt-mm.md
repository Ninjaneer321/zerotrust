# Zero Trust Maturity Model

[Executive Order 14028, "Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/), pushes agencies to adopt zero trust cybersecurity principles and adjust their network architectures accordingly.

To help this effort, the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://cisa.gov) (CISA) developed a Zero Trust Maturity Model to assist agencies as they implement zero trust architectures. The maturity model complements the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Federal Zero Trust Strategy, and is designed to provide agencies with a roadmap and resources to achieve an optimal zero trust environment.

## How to comment

CISA is holding a public comment period on the Zero Trust Maturity Model from September 7, 2021 until **October 1, 2021**. During that time, reviewers can submit their comments and feedback to **[tic@cisa.dhs.gov](mailto:example@cisa.gov)**.

CISA hopes that agency, industry, and academia will participate in the comment period to ensure the maturity model fully addresses all considerations for zero trust.
