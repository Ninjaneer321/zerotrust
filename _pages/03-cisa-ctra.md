# Cloud Security Technical Reference Architecture

The [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://cisa.gov) (CISA), in collaboration with the [United States Digital Service](https://usds.gov) and [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov), developed the **Cloud Security Technical Reference Architecture** (TRA) in accordance with Section 3(c)(ii) of [Executive Order 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/).

As the federal government continues to transition to the cloud, this TA will be a guide for agencies to leverage when migrating to the cloud securely. The document explains considerations for shared services, cloud migration, and cloud security posture management.
