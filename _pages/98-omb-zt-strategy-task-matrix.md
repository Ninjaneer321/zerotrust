### Appendix B: Task Matrix

| **Section** | **Task** | **Agency Action Timeline (Deadlines Measured From Date of Issuance of This Memorandum)** |
| General | Agencies must submit to OMB and CISA an implementation plan for FY22-FY24 for OMB concurrence, and a budget estimate for FY23-24. |Within 60 days. |
| Identity | Agencies must employ centralized identity management systems for agency users that can be integrated into applications and common platforms. | Include in agency implementation plan. |
| Identity | Agencies must require their users to use a phishing-resistant method to access agency-hosted accounts. | Include in agency implementation plan. |
| Identity | Public-facing agency systems that support MFA must give users the option of using phishing-resistant authentication. | Within one year. |
| Identity | Agencies must remove password policies that require special characters and regular password rotation from all systems. | Within one year. |
| Identity | Agency authorization systems should work to incorporate at least one device-level signal alongside identity information about the authenticated user. | Include in agency implementation plan. |
| Devices | Agencies must create ongoing, reliable, and complete asset inventories, including by leveraging the CDM program. | Include in agency implementation plan. |
| Devices | Agencies must ensure their EDR tools meet CISA's technical requirements and are deployed and operated across their agency. | See [M-22-01](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/M-22-01.pdf). |

| Applications and Workloads | Agencies must select at least one FISMA Moderate system that requires authentication and is not currently internet-accessible, and securely allow full-featured operation over the internet. | Within one year. |
| Applications and Workloads | Agencies must begin providing CISA and GSA any non-.gov hostnames used by their internet-accessible information systems. | Within 60 days. |
| Applications and Workloads | Agencies should work toward employing immutable workloads when deploying services, especially in cloud-based infrastructure. | Include in agency implementation plan. |
| Data | Agency Chief Data Officers must work with key agency stakeholders to develop a set of initial categorizations for sensitive electronic documents within their enterprise, with the goal of automatically monitoring and potentially restricting how these documents are shared. | Within 120 days. |
